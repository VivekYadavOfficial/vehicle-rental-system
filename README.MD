This is an academic project in the 5th semester of my B.Tech program.
This is a complementary project for the course of Database Management System. The project uses MySQL for the database management and HTML,CSS and PHP for the front-end and interface to database.
The project has features such as vehicle rented, vehicle available and history of rented along with person detail.
The project also allows admin to add new vehicles to the database, delete the vehicles, modify the rate etc.
The project is not complete yet but it will be as soon as I get the time.

Thank You.
